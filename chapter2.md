    once upon a time, there was a door factory. 
    The door factory contained every single possible door you could think of. 
    People from all over the world would come to see the doors, but only the richest of the rich were able to afford one of the doors. Not only did they have to be rich, they would have to be skilled. 
    The door factory itself was a maze that only the brightest and bravest could get through. One false move and you die. 
    But once you get into the center of the factory, there is a door that allows you to teleport to anywhere you want to. 
    The door factory is selling this door for no money, because it is worth more than any amount of money. 
    The only way to obtain it is to eat the door. 
    You have to be able to eat it piece by piece, until there is nothing left. 
    However, if you don't finish eating it in 5 minutes, then you die. 
    No one in the history of man kind has ever gotten to the door, so eating it in 5 minutes was even more unthinkable.
