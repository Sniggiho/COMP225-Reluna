The Burning Menace, as he would come to be known, was really named Jeff Wang. 
Burning was his favorite. 
His joy in it started with family bonfires, s'mores, and lawnchairs. 
But that it accelerated from there. 
The burn, the heat, was insatiable. 
It filled his soul, and he begged for the flames to dance again. 
He hew old furniture to throw it in the fire, aged cloth turning black and crisp and curling. 
His favorite thing to burn however, was doors. 
He loved to watch it the shaped wood groan in agony, and slowly but surely lose all of its life sources and turn into nothing but a pile of ash.
