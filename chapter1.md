The Burning Menace, as he would come to be known, was really named Jeff Wang. 
Burning was his favorite thing ever. 
His joy in it started with family bonfires, s'mores, and lawnchairs. 
But that it accelerated from there. 
The burn, the heat, was insatiable. 
It filled his soul, and he begged for the flames to dance again. 
He got old furniture to throw it in the fire, aged cloth turning black and crisp and curling. 
His favorite victim however, was doors. 
He loves to watch the tortured wood submitting to his will, burning in agony and a slowly losing its liveliness until it eventually turns into a pile of ash.
