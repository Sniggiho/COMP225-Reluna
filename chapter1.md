The Burning Menace, as he would come to be known, was really named Jeff Wang. 
Burning was his favorite thing ever. 
His joy in it started with family bonfires, s'mores, and lawnchairs. 
But that it accelerated from there. 
The burn, the heat, was insatiable. 
It filled his soul, and he begged for the flames to dance again. 
He got old furniture to throw it in the fire, aged cloth turning black and crisp and curling. 
He burned more and more, larger and larger targets.
Eventually he set his sights on the biggest possible target: the door factory.
He bought matches, he bought gasoline, he made an escape plan (that is, installed uber). He was ready.
