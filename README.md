# COMP225-Reluna
Macalester COMP225 course project - team Reluna - Modernized Eartraining for Everyone

Developed in [Godot 4.1.1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/4.1.1-stable). Once you have cloned this repo, open the `project.godot` file with Godot's import. Then the project will open. 
Currently, the scene `firstScene` is our main game screen and `menuScreen` is our starting screen. If it isn't automatically opened, navigate to it in `res://Scenes/menuScreen.tscn`. Once it is opened, click the play button at the top left.
