COMP225 course project, team Reluna, Modernized Eartraining

Developed in [Godot 4.1.1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/4.1.1-stable). Once you have cloned this repo, open the `project.godot` file with Godot's import. Then the project will open. 
Currently, the scene `firstScene` is our main screen. If it isn't automatically opened, navigate to it in `res://Scenes/firstScene.tscn`. Once it is opened, click the play button at the top left.
