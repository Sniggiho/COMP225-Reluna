Door factory in flames, DoorFactoryBurningGuy (that is to say, Jeff) stepped outside the door factory, ready to make his great escape. 
Unfortunately, there was also a big football game just getting out at the nearby stadium.
Uber surge pricing was ABSURD.
Like crazy. Wild. Unthinkable. 
$60 for a ride home??? DoorFactoryBurningGuy can't afford that. 
Stuck, stranded, red handed, and broke, DoorFactoryBurningGuy was quickly cornered by the cops. 
On the upside, his ride to the jail cell was free.
